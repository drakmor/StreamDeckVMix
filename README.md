# StreamDeckVMix
Simple program to control vMix from a Streamdeck

Uses the OpenStreamDeck C# wrapper (https://github.com/OpenStreamDeck/StreamDeckSharp), as well as some code from vMixScheduler (https://github.com/Tim-R/vScheduler).

I am not a programmer, but did want to share my efforts in case anyone could benefit from them.

Support for 4 inputs, 3 overlays, streaming, recording, quick play, and cut.

The three overlay channels send the item currently in preview to the overlay channel.
